        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">As I walked a long I suddenly noticed throne at the end of the room with the demon Behemoth standing near it.</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">Behemoth smiles at me,"You have done well human. Who wouldh have thought you would make it this far."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">So many questions run through my mind, but first I need to ask why," Behemoth what is all this about? Why am I here, why did I have to do all of this."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">Behemoth walks towards me with his arms open, "I saw you in your world. I saw what had happened to you. No longer did you feel joy, and you begged god to help or release you."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">"But he never responded. I decided to take pity on you. Bring you here so that we may make a deal for your hapiness."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">"You see in hell we can only ask questions, and sadly you can only go through this once with another demon. Mean once you challenge that demon you can never challenge that demon again."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">"I had challenged the very same demons you challenged, and I lost terribley."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">stepping back from Behemoth, "Why did you need to defeat them. What surpose do these items hold."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">Behemoth lowers his arms and grins, "Have you not figured out who I am? You would think a quiz master like yourself would know?"</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">I shudder with the realization,"Your Satan are you not?"</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">Behemoth starts to clap,"Yes, very good my champion, and for the items. I need them to reign over this realm again. All you need to do is give them to me so that I may sit upon my throne once more."</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">"Doing so will allow me to grant you peace! I will be rid of all of those who have hurt you! All that stand in your way will be tortured with remarkable pain!"</span>
        <span class="dialogThirteenth page">"No longer shall you be weak. You will become a god amongst all man kind! My right hand in bringing down punishment upon the weak humans."</span>
